# vanilla_neural_network
Vanilla neural network to understand the underlying mechanisms. 

The neural network on this project is made to recognize hand written digits.

## Original work
This project is based on the work of Michael Nielsen and its online book http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com

Most of the code is from his book (https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning)

## Change from the original source code
I integrated modifications to use Michael code with Python 3.6

Modifications will be made as well in order to follow some of the exercices present in Michael's book.

## Associated data
The data (images from MNIST) area available on Michael Nielsen github under Zip format.
